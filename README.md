# Levers
This is a Python package for visualizing lever mechanisms and animated geometry. It allows you to describe a moving mechanism or geometric construction in just a few lines of code and run its visualization using one of available renderers.

The project core has no external dependencies. However, for visualization you can use one of the renderer plugins that require certain dependencies (or easily code one youself). Thus all the dependencies are optional and can be selected during installation.
